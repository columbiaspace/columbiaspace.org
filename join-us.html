     This past year, we sent a payload to the ISS, competed in the final rounds of NASA competitions, and performed a static fire of a rocket. In the past, we have tested devices in NASA's Neutral Buoyancy Lab, presented mission proposals at Cape Canaveral, and launched high altitude balloons (with <a href='https://youtu.be/5US99GBWdAA'>Roaree</a>!).
     </p>
     <p>
     We've hosted over twenty space-related public events, featuring astronauts and other members of the space industry, with a total of over 1,300 attending. In addition, we have held workshops for K-12 students around New York City, in places ranging from the Intrepid Sea, Air, and Space Museum to the NY Hall of Science.
     </p>
     <p>
     Because Columbia does not offer an aerospace program, our club offers the only opportunity for students to pursue or discover their interests in space technology and outreach. As a collaborative endeavor, designing for space has taught us engineering skills for working under tight constraints and teamwork skills. These valuable skills have helped our members succeed during their internships at such places as Boeing, SpaceX, NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Johnson Space Center, and Marshall Space Flight Center.
