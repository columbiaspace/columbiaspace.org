        The Columbia Space Initiative (CSI) consists of 13 “missions”, which are projects dedicated to exploring various
        topics related to space science, engineering, outreach, and policy. CSI has no applications and is open to all
        current Columbia/Barnard students. Students can join one or multiple missions, and we recommend that prospective
        members explore several at the start of the year! For more info on these missions, check out each mission's
        page, or read their blubs all together on the <a href="/index.html#missions">homepage</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a club, we hold weekly general body meetings on Fridays at 4pm. Gbody meetings are held in Mudd, the
        Engineering building on the corner of 120th St. and Amsterdam Ave, in room 833. Many of CSI missions meet
        directly afterwards, although there are a few exceptions. Please check the Slack mission channels for meeting
        times or ask mission leads if you are unsure!

          Welcome to the 2024–2025 CSI year! Everyone should attend our annual Liftoff Meeting on September 13th at 4pm
          in Lerner Cinema to get all the information you need about CSI and individual missions. If you miss Liftoff
          due to schedule conflicts or religious observances, don’t worry! A link to the recording will be posted in
          Slack over the weekend.

     This past year, we sent a payload to the ISS, competed in the final rounds of NASA competitions, and performed a static fire of a rocket. In the past, we have tested devices in NASA's Neutral Buoyancy Lab, presented mission proposals at Cape Canaveral, and launched high altitude balloons (with <a href='https://youtu.be/5US99GBWdAA'>Roaree</a>!).
     </p>
     <p>
     We've hosted over twenty space-related public events, featuring astronauts and other members of the space industry, with a total of over 1,300 attending. In addition, we have held workshops for K-12 students around New York City, in places ranging from the Intrepid Sea, Air, and Space Museum to the NY Hall of Science.
     </p>
     <p>
     Because Columbia does not offer an aerospace program, our club offers the only opportunity for students to pursue or discover their interests in space technology and outreach. As a collaborative endeavor, designing for space has taught us engineering skills for working under tight constraints and teamwork skills. These valuable skills have helped our members succeed during their internships at such places as Boeing, SpaceX, NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Johnson Space Center, and Marshall Space Flight Center.
