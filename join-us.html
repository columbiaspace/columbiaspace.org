		<h3>How to Join</h3>

			<li style="margin: 10px 0;">The Columbia Space Initiative consists of 10 “missions”, which are projects spanning various topics related to earth and space science. Students can join one or multiple, and we recommend that prospective students explore multiple missions at the start of the year! For more info on our missions, check out these mission descriptions or our website (<a href="http://columbiaspace.org">columbiaspace.org</a>).</li>

			<li style="margin: 10px 0;">We will initiate the 2023-2024 CSI year soon! You can find us at the September 8th campus Activities Fair, and everyone should attend our annual Liftoff Meeting, on September 15th, to get all the information you need about CSI and individual missions! Location will be announced in Slack.</li>

			<li style="margin: 10px 0;">CSI has no application! We are open to all active Columbia/Barnard students.</li>

			<li style="margin: 10px 0;">As a club, we hold general body meetings weekly on Fridays at 4pm. Gbody meetings are held in Mudd, the Engineering building on the corner of 120th St and Amsterdam Ave, room 833. The majority of CSI missions meet directly afterwards, although there are a few exceptions. Please ask mission leads about scheduling.</li>

			<li style="margin: 10px 0;">Find us on Slack and sign up with your school email. We use Slack for internal communications, announcements, memes, file storage, and more. You can download Slack as an app or open it up in your browser.</li>

			<ul>
				<li>Please add a contact photo if you’re comfortable doing so, as this helps all of us get to know each other.</li>
				<li>Join a few channels! Interested in a few particular missions? Click “add channel”, and search the mission name. Feel free to poke around!</li>
				<li style="">Direct message Co-Presidents Matthew Werneken or Minju O’Rourke at any time with questions, or ask in a mission channel. We try to reserve #general for announcements and club-wide notifications.</li>
			</ul>

This is a nice tl;dr of all the Slack announcements.</li>

     This past year, we sent a payload to the ISS, competed in the final rounds of NASA competitions, and performed a static fire of a rocket. In the past, we have tested devices in NASA's Neutral Buoyancy Lab, presented mission proposals at Cape Canaveral, and launched high altitude balloons (with <a href='https://youtu.be/5US99GBWdAA'>Roaree</a>!).
     </p>
     <p>
     We've hosted over twenty space-related public events, featuring astronauts and other members of the space industry, with a total of over 1,300 attending. In addition, we have held workshops for K-12 students around New York City, in places ranging from the Intrepid Sea, Air, and Space Museum to the NY Hall of Science.

     Because Columbia does not offer an aerospace program, our club offers the only opportunity for students to pursue or discover their interests in space technology and outreach. As a collaborative endeavor, designing for space has taught us engineering skills for working under tight constraints and teamwork skills. These valuable skills have helped our members succeed during their internships at such places as Boeing, SpaceX, NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Johnson Space Center, and Marshall Space Flight Center.
