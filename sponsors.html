introtext: "Getting to space is expensive. We would not succeed without support from our university, student councils, and NASA. With every semester, our members dream of bigger and more expensive challenges, requiring us to seek more support. We are grateful for any form of financial aid, material support, software donations, and mentorship made available by our
sponsors. Our sponsors are members of our team, and we proudly advertise their names in as many mediums as possible, even the projects we launch to space. We hope you join us on our pursuit toward the final frontier."
