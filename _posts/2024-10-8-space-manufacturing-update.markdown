Space Manufacturing traveled to Bel Air, Maryland September 28th to present their novel 3D printer at 3DPrintopia (formerly East Coast Rep Rap Festival). 3DPrintopia is a conference and celebration of everything 3D printing. Industry leaders, individual makers, and companies presented innovative 3D printers, materials, and the latest in 3D printing technology. A wide range of projects ranging from novel multi material filaments to diamond tipped nozzles were shared.
<br><br>
 CSI’s Space Manufacturing mission is exploring and developing new methods to enable the next generation of self-reliant off earth missions. For the past two years the mission has been designing and manufacturing a novel 3D printer that was unveiled to the wider 3D printing community at 3DPrintopia. Attendees were interested in the printer’s design and applications. The team received valuable feedback ranging from the electronics for use in space to frame construction. The team was especially excited to connect with the founder of Prusa, Joseph Prusa and other industry representatives including E3D, LDO Motors, KB3D, Freepeeko, among others.
<br><br>
After a great time learning from fellow 3D printing enthusiasts’ projects and feedback, Space Manufacturing is ready to tackle its next objective: developing a novel printer to print lunar regolith!
<br><br>
The trip was a great success and we hope to return next year!
