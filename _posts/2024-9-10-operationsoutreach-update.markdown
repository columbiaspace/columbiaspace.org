This past spring, CSIâ€™s Outreach team won the Robert D. Lilley Award for Socially Responsible Engineering. We were awarded for our work with our educational space science program that reached over 1,000 students in the past year. We are so honored to be recognized with this award and look forward to continuing our work in exposing STEM to middle schoolers across the city!
