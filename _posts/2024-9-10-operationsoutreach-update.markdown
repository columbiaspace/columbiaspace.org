This past spring, CSI’s Outreach team received the Robert D. Lilley Award for Socially Responsible Engineering at Columbia’s 2024 Leadership and Excellence Awards. This award is presided over by the Dean of the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences at Columbia, and is given to engineering groups that focus on engineering projects in economically or socially disadvantaged areas, student research projects directed towards topics that relate to socially responsible engineering, and campus education efforts that focus on engineering ethics, among other things.

We were awarded for our work with our educational space science program that reached over 1,000 students in under-resourced middle schools in the past year. Some of our work includes model rocketry, a balloon-dropping activity, and a paper-airplane lesson. In our model rocket lessons, we teach students about aerodynamics and design considerations when making a rocket, then they build their own rockets with components manufactured by CSI volunteers. We then launch the rockets, which is always a fun and exciting activity for students and Outreach members. The balloon-drop activity includes Outreach members also volunteer as space science educators at a summer camp hosted by our partner, Sophie Gerson Healthy Youth. The summer camp programming includes all of the activities mentioned before, and we also provide the opportunity for students to learn about and view constellations and planets through CSI-provided telescopes. We are so honored to be recognized with this award and look forward to continuing our work in exposing STEM to middle schoolers across the city!
