The Astrobiology mission spent the academic year learning about spaceflight and its effects on biological systems–namely, spaceflight-induced anemia and decreased bone density due to long-term exposure to microgravity.

The project aimed to identify changes in the quantity of genetic material pre- and post-exposure to microgravity. To achieve this, the team designed, prototyped, and implemented their own in-flight hardware, which allowed for a timed release of DNA/RNA preservative into HeLa cells for further extraction, isolation, and quantification.

From May 17th to May 24th, the team took their samples to Boston to collaborate with the George Church Lab at Harvard, and to New Hampshire to work with Weill Cornell’s Dr. Christopher E. Mason for an authentic microgravity experience via the Aurelia Institute and their parabolic flight programming.

See below for a selection of pictures from their visits.
