CSI’s 2024 Micro-g tool, the SEE LION, was an autonomous camera and computer system that utilized image recognition model techniques to identify objects present during an unassisted egress scenario from the Orion capsule (astronauts floating wearing an underarm life preserver, astronaut multi-person life raft, etc). The mechanism was required to be built using off-the-shelf hardware, splash-proof for poolside testing, and operate within an allotted time.

Throughout the development of the SEE LION, a large emphasis was placed on ensuring a smooth and straightforward user experience due to the time-sensitive nature of retrieving astronauts upon returning to Earth. The system, consisting of a tripod-mounted camera, a pelican case containing the necessary computing resources, a laptop with a dedicated user interface for the system, and a secondary monitor, was ideated to minimize the complexity of the tool and allow the operator to quickly set up the SEE LION with simple instructions.

Our year-long project culminated in our team traveling to NASA’s Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory (NBL) in Houston, Texas. At the NBL, we were invited on multiple tours that spanned the buildings housing Artemis Program space shuttles and equipment to old Apollo and Soviet space systems. Additionally, we spent time at Mission Control watching the controllers in real time and working with people on the ISS, which was an exciting experience. As the week progressed, our SEE LION was tested at the Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory pool, undergoing strict procedural checks to maintain the highest levels of safety and accuracy. Through daily testing and troubleshooting, we successfully identified three of the four objects at the NBL with a high confidence of identification. As our session at the NBL started winding down, we connected with the Micro-G team at UT Dallas and bonded over some iconic Texas barbeque. It was a satisfying experience and a wellworth trip for all of us, receiving important feedback from NASA and meeting some amazing individuals. We can’t wait for the next chance to return to NASA with a new team!
