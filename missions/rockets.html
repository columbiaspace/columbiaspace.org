abstracttitle: "Building high-powered hybrid rockets for experimental payloads."
abstracttext: "Making rockets is cool, launching them to 40k ft is cooler. Join us in our journey to the desert to throttle and launch our student designed and built rocket on an international stage."

introtext: "The CSI Rocketry mission designs, builds, and tests high-powered
hybrid rockets. We have had two successful launches in a row now. One launch of a 30k 805 lbf. rocket at Spaceport America Cup and one launch of a 25k 1200 lbf. rocket at FAR-OUT in June 2024.
Every year we aim to refine control over our rocket,
achieve higher altitude launches, and develop an innovative scientific payload
for the short durations of micro and hypergravity in the flight. From designing
a rocket engine from scratch to developing reliable long range wifi
communications, the team is always in need of dedicated students from any
background — computer science to mechanical engineering to business and biology
— with a passion for experimental sounding rocketry and companies who can
support our efforts."

goals: true
goalstext: "This year, we will continue to refine and improve our design for a 2000 lbf Class O nitrous-oxide/paraffin wax hybrid rocket engine and launch to 40K.;
We also aim to regenerative cool the combustion chamber using a nitrous oxide preflow arrangement.;
Using nitrogen pressure regulation and a two stage valve we aim to throttle our thrust and complete a milestone of the lander challenge."
