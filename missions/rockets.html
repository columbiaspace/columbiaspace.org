abstracttext: "CSI’s Rocketry mission is escaping the Earth's surface without aid from NASA or helium. Just good, old-fashioned rocket fuel!"

introtext: "The CSI Rocketry mission designs, builds, and tests high-powered
hybrid rockets. We have had two successful launches in a row now. One launch of a 30k 805 lbf. rocket at Spaceport America Cup and one launch of a 25k 1200 lbf. rocket at FAR-OUT in June 2024.
Every year we aim to refine control over our rocket,
achieve higher altitude launches, and develop an innovative scientific payload
for the short durations of micro and hypergravity in the flight. From designing
a rocket engine from scratch to developing reliable long range wifi
communications, the team is always in need of dedicated students from any
background — computer science to mechanical engineering to business and biology
— with a passion for experimental sounding rocketry and companies who can
support our efforts."
