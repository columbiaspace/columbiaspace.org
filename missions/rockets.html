abstracttitle: "Building high-powered hybrid rockets for experimental payloads."
abstracttext: "Making rockets is cool, launching them to 50k ft is cooler. Join us in our journey to the desert to throttle and launch our student designed and built rocket on an international stage."

introtext: "CSI Rockets designs, builds, and flies LOX/Paraffin hybrid rockets. After successful launches in 2023, 2024, and 2025, we are continuing to learn, iterate, and test as we build more capable rockets. 
<br><br>
Every year we aim to achieve higher altitude launches, develop an innovative scientific payloads, improve our composites and structures, and achieve a higher test cadence. From designing a rocket engine from scratch to building custom flight computers, the team is always in need of dedicated students from any background with a passion for experimental sounding rocketry."
