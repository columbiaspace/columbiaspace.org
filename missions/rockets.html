abstracttext: "CSI’s Rocketry mission is escaping the Earth's surface without aid from NASA or helium. Just good, old-fashioned rocket fuel!"

introtext: "The CSI Rocketry mission designs, builds, and tests high-powered
hybrid rockets. Our most recent success, the launch of our 30k ft, 805 lbf
rocket at the Spaceport America Cup in New Mexico, was also our most powerful
and ambitious one yet. Every year we aim to refine control over our rocket,
achieve higher altitude launches, and develop an innovative scientific payload
for the short durations of micro and hypergravity in the flight. From designing
a rocket engine from scratch to developing reliable long range wifi
communications, the team is always in need of dedicated students from any
background — computer science to mechanical engineering to business and biology
— with a passion for experimental sounding rocketry and companies who can
support our efforts."
