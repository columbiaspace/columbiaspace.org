abstracttext: "Building the first satellite designed by Columbia undergraduates
to be launched into low Earth orbit."

introtext: "The CSI CubeSat team is preparing to launch Columbia University’s
first satellite, the Line Imaging Orbiter for Nanosatellite-Enabled
Spectrographic Surveys; LIONESS for short. The CubeSat is a partnership with the
Schiminovich Astronomy and Instrumentation Lab, and will host an integral field
unit (IFU) spectrograph inspired by the lab’s ground-based spectrograph. It will
study diffuse gasses in nearby galaxies, as well as serve as the basis of CSI
outreach programming in NYC middle schools this year.<br><br>

LIONESS is still in early stages of development, but has received phenomenal
support from the University Nanosat Program, who hosted four of our members as
full-time interns on the mission in Summer 2023, and from the CubeSat Launch
Initiative, which has awarded our mission a funded launch by 2027."
