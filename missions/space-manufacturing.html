abstracttext: "CSI’s Space Manufacturing mission is working to develop 3D printers for use in space."

introtext: "Space Manufacturing is exploring and developing new methods to enable the next generation of self-reliant off-Earth missions. Our goal is to reduce the frequency—and eventually—the need for resupply missions, to make life off the planet truly independent. We are particularly interested in using additive manufacturing and on-planet resources to manufacture the tools and materials needed for sustained for sustained human presence in space."
