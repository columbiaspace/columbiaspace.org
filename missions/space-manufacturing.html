abstracttext: "CSI’s Space Manufacturing mission is working to build 3D printers for use in space."

introtext: "Space Manufacturing is exploring and developing new methods to
enable the next generation of self-reliant off earth missions. Our goal is to
reduce the frequency—and eventually—the need for resupply missions, to make life
off the planet truly independent. We are particularly interested in using
additive manufacturing and on planet resources to manufacture."
