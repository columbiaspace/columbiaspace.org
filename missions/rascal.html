abstracttext: "Students compete in NASA’s RASC-AL competition, designing technology that will allow future crewed missions to survive in space."

introtext: "RASC-AL is a university-level competition sponsored by NASA and the National
Institute of Aerospace (NIA) to design concept mission architectures to ensure
the survival of future crewed missions in space.<br><br> Columbia Space Initiative's RASC-AL
mission is a team of dedicated engineers and scientists seeking to expand the boundaries of
lunar exploration. In the past, challenges have been based around the
development of lunar satellites and rovers with potential implications for
future Artemis missions. Using hands-on involvement and technical proposal
writing skills, we spend the year developing and fine tuning innovative technology that not
only takes humans to the moon but also ensures that we can thrive there. If
selected, the team will build a prototype to present and demonstrate its
capabilities at the annual RASC-AL Forum to NASA and NIA personnel in June."
