abstracttext: "Students compete in NASA’s RASC-AL competition, designing technology that will allow future crewed missions to survive in space."

introtext: "RASC-AL is a university-level competition sponsored by NASA and the 
National Institute of Aerospace (NIA) to design concept mission architectures to
 ensure the survival of future crewed missions in space.
<br><br> 
Columbia’s RASC-AL mission is a team of dedicated engineers and scientists seeking
to expand the boundaries of lunar and martian exploration. In the past, challenges
have been based around the development of lunar satellites and martian rovers 
with potential implications for future Artemis missions. Using hands-on involvement
and technical proposal writing skills, we spend the year developing and fine-tuning
innovative technology that takes humans to the Moon and Mars and ensures that we 
can thrive there. If selected, the team will build a prototype to present and 
demonstrate its capabilities at the annual RASC-AL Forum to NASA and NIA personnel in 
June.
<br><br>
This year’s objective is to design a mission concept aimed at reducing the risks 
associated with human exploration/presence on Mars and helping to foster a permanent
human presence there. The team will have total freedom to develop a start-to-finish 
mission plan that showcases an innovative approach to a martian exploration.
