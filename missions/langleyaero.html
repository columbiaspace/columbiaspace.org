abstracttext: "Leveraging Digital Twin design for UAV Optimization"

introtext: "Our undergraduate team is rising to the challenge of designing, building, and optimizing a UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) for the purpose of urban delivery. We will be building a UAV that can achieve vertical take-off and landing while also maximizing payload. Additionally, we will also be programming a digital twin for the UAV. This digital twin will take the form of a live interface that utilizes in-flight data to gain insight into the current state of the UAV and its surroundings."
