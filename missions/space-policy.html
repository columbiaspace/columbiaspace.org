abstracttext: "To design and propose a comprehensive plan for an international ban on space weapons, fostering collaboration among national space agencies and relevant international bodies."

introtext: "The objective of this mission is to develop a proposal for a legislative body, in the form of a research paper, addressing the imperative of international collaboration in space exploration. The focus will be on the urgent need for a global consensus on banning space weapons. To achieve this, multiple national space agencies and international organizations like the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs will be engaged. Additionally, the mission will embrace a diverse range of students from non-STEM disciplines such as political science, economics, international relations, history, and psychology. This approach will enhance the scope of CSI's endeavors and foster interdisciplinary opportunities."
