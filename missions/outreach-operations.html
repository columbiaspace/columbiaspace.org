space science and engineering for local NYC students"

introtext: "The Outreach arm of the Columbia Space Initiative (CSI) has been
focused for several years on connecting with and engaging middle school students
throughout New York City. Our educational programming is specifically focused on
space science and engineering topics, and is developed to increase exposure to
not only STEM concepts, but also professional and educational pathways within
STEM fields. We work primarily with students underrepresented in STEM, and in
the previous academic year, our efforts brought enriching experiences to over
800 students in total. <br><br> Through our partnership with local non-profit
Sophie Gerson Healthy Youth (SGHY), CSI volunteers visit schools to teach
students about aerospace engineering and science, serve as guides for science
museum trips, invite students to campus to learn about CSI’s many technical
missions, and volunteer as summer camp astronomy counselors. We also host a
semester-long project where students get to design, build, and launch their own
model rockets, and are currently working to develop new programming centered
around our cube satellite mission."
