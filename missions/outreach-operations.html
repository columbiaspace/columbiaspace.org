space science and engineering for local NYC students"

introtext: "The Outreach branch of the Columbia Space Initiative (CSI) has 
been focused for several years on connecting with and engaging middle and 
high school students throughout New York City. Our educational programming 
is specifically focused on space science and engineering topics, and is 
developed to increase exposure to and engagement with not only STEM concepts, 
but also to professional and educational pathways within STEM fields. We work 
primarily with students underrepresented in STEM, and in the previous academic
year, our efforts brought enriching experiences to over 1000 students in total.
<br><br> Through our partnership with local non-profit Sophie Gerson Healthy 
Youth (SGHY), CSI volunteers visit schools to teach students about aerospace 
engineering and science, serve as guides for science museum trips, invite students
 to campus to learn about CSI's many technical missions, and volunteer as summer 
 camp astronomy counselors. We also host a semester-long project where students 
 get to design, build, and launch their own model rockets, and are currently 
 working to develop new programming centered around our cube satellite mission."
