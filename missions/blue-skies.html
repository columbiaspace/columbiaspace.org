introtext: "
Blue Skies is a NASA competition that challenges students to create visionary, climate-friendly solutions for the future of aviation. Our mission is to take on this challenge and think beyond conventional limits, working together and outside the box to solve modern aviation problems. We submit our initial project proposal to NASA in February and, if approved, receive $9,000 for our project to move on to the National competition at NASA Langley in May. Winning teams receive an internship with NASA.
<br><br>
We bring together students with diverse skills, passions, and backgrounds at Blue Skies. From engineers to English majors to environmental scientists, everyone at Blue Skies gains hands-on experience in engineering design, entrepreneurship, and teamwork, all while contributing to the broader goal of sustainable flight.
