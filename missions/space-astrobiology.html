abstracttitle: "Developing countermeasures to safeguard astronaut health"
abstracttext: "We integrate biological and engineering research to develop solutions to mitigate the detrimental effects of spaceflight on cellular and human physiology. "

introtext: "With growing interest in commercial spaceflight and NASA’s Artemis mission to send the first humans to Mars, addressing the short-term and potential long-term health issues that astronauts may face has become increasingly critical. Astrobiology contributes to this research.

Over the past few years, our student-led team conducted a wide range of space biology projects, including sending a payload to the International Space Station to study how microgravity affects bacterial resistance to antibiotics, collaborating with NASA’s Biotechnology and Planetary Protection Group to investigate the antimicrobial properties of zinc oxide in microgravity, and partnering with the Mason Lab at Weill Cornell Medicine and the Church Lab at Harvard to explore the role of dysfunctional mitochondrial transfer in spaceflight-induced anemia. We also led a city-wide study on bacterial load across the New York City subway system. In the past year, we completed the design and assembly of a 3D clinostat to simulate microgravity conditions and developed a system to automate the delivery of biological samples into RNAlater™"
