abstracttitle: "Elucidating the Effects of Microgravity on Biological and Chemical Systems"
abstracttext: "We are currently studying spaceflight-driven anemia in the context of the bone marrow microenvironment."

introtext: "Astrobiology encompasses the nexus between biological,
biomedical and chemical sciences within an engineering-focused environment.
Spaceflight, and more specifically the phenomena of microgravity and radiation,
perturb biological cells in countless ways. Understanding exactly how this
occurs is an ongoing challenge; this mission contributes to this research
tradition, pursuing projects to promote a vision of long-term human spaceflight."
