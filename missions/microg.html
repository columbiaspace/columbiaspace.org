abstracttitle: "Developing Astronaut Tools for Use In Microgravity"
abstracttext: "Join us in creating a tool dock to be used on International Space Station missions!"

introtext: "Extravehicular activities (EVAs) are essential to maintaining the ISS and often a highlight for astronauts. During EVAs, astronauts carry multiple tools that must be securely stowed, typically on the Mini Work Station (MWS) swingarms at the hip. Current stowage methods require dedicated actuation, which can be cumbersome during long EVAs with limited mobility. All stowage systems must meet single-fault tolerance to prevent tool loss, which could jeopardize mission objectives.
<br><br>
This year's objective is to design a glove-compatible EVA tool dock that enables one-handed installation without touching the receptacle or requiring dedicated actuation. Despite this, the dock must retain tools with single-fault tolerance—requiring two distinct actions to release. Ergonomics are critical, as astronauts operate with restricted movement in bulky suits. The design will be evaluated in NASA’s Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory (NBL) for functionality and operational feasibility.
