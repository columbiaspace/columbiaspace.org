abstracttext: "Building a rocket is cool, going to NASAâ€™s Johnson Space Center is COOLER! Join Micro-G NExT where we design, develop, and test a lunar regolith sampling device and make other teams eat our (lunar) DUST!"

introtext: "Microgravity Neutral Buoyancy Experiment Design Teams (Micro-g NExT) 
challenges undergraduate students to design, build, and test a tool or device that
addresses an authentic, current space exploration challenge. The overall 
experience includes hands-on engineering design, test operations, and public 
outreach. Teams will conduct test operations in the simulated microgravity 
environment of the NASA Johnson Space Center Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory (NBL). 
Teams will propose the design and prototyping of a tool or simulant identified 
by NASA engineers as necessary for space exploration missions. Professional NBL
divers will test the tools, and students will direct the divers from the Test 
Conductor Room of the NBL facility. Micro-g NExT provides a unique opportunity 
for students to contribute to NASA's missions.

NASA's Artemis III mission aims to collect lunar regolith samples from the Moon's
south pole. A key focus is studying the top 1-5mm of regolith to understand space
weathering and the Moon's history. To do this, astronauts need a Contact Sampling 
Device that can gather undisturbed samples, preserve their orientation, and safely
return them to Earth. The device must be glove-compatible, easy to use in a 
spacesuit, and securely seal the sample. Drawing from past missions like Apollo and
OSIRIS-Rex, the design should improve on previous methods. It will be tested for 
functionality in NASA's Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory and for sampling capability in 
the Simulant Development Lab.
