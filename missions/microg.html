abstracttitle: "Developing Astronaut Tools for Use In Microgravity"
abstracttext: "CSI's Micro-G team conceptualizes, designs, and creates tools for testing in NASA's microgravity Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory."

introtext: "Micro-g NExT is an annual NASA competition in which teams compete to
design and manufacture tools intended to function in microgravity environments.
In the past, challenges have been based on problems astronauts may face on the
International Space Station, during spacewalks, and on the moon during the
upcoming Artemis Missions. Throughout the academic year, students work alongside
NASA engineers through the full iterative design process, including the creation
and delivery of several proposals, design reviews, academic papers, and
presentations. If selected, tools are taken to NASA's Neutral Buoyancy
Laboratory—an astronaut training facility near the Johnson Space Center in
Houston, TX—where they are tested by a professional diver."
