abstracttext: "We are building an ISS payload experiment to study antibiotic resistance in space."

introtext: "
CARMEn is an autonomous ISS experiment designed by the SPOCS team investigating the differences in growth patterns and antibiotic resistance of the bacteria <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> and <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em> when grown in a dual-species biofilm. The experiment won NASA’s SPOCS payload design competition in December 2020, earning $20,000 from NASA to build and fly CARMEn to the International Space Station for 30 days. The team is currently working on payload prototyping, testing of biological protocols, and conducting outreach and citizen science opportunities with partnered middle and high schools.
