abstracttext: "CSI works on putting people in space, BS focuses on what it means to put PEOPLE in space!"

introtext: "The BS Mission is a BRAND NEW (!!!) CSI mission dedicated to researching about human behavioral and mental processes and, more specifically, how they relate and apply to human spaceflight. Over the course of the year, members will work together on picking a general topic to research, researching available data and literature within the topic, finding a gap in awareness to address, and writing about a potential way to fill that gap based on our research, with the end goal of presenting our work at a relevant conference in Summer or Early Fall of 2026. BS is extremely chill and open to anyone! The timeline is relaxed and flexible enough that BS could easily be added on alongside of another CSI mission, and it is open to anyone interested in human factors research for spaceflight. No need to be a behavioral science major-- we all have brains, so we can all contribute to researching them! Weekly BS Mission meetings will be THURSDAYS from 8:00 PM - 9:00 PM! We hope to see you there!."
