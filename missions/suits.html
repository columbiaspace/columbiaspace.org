abstracttitle: "Wearable Augmented Reality for Space Suits"
abstracttext: "NASA SUITS (Spacesuit User Interface Technologies for Students) challenges students to design and create spacesuit information displays within augmented reality (AR) environments. "

introtext: "NASA’s Artemis missions aim to return American astronauts to the Moon for the first time since Apollo, but the ambition to explore goes far beyond that. Artemis lays the foundation for a sustained lunar presence that will serve as a gateway to deeper space exploration — and eventually, human missions to Mars. These goals, however, come with unprecedented challenges, such as the 20-minute communication delay between Earth and Mars. Our team is addressing these challenges through the NASA SUITS 2025–2026 challenge."

goals: true
goalstext: "
Development of a dual-monitor Localized Mission Control Center (LMCC) to give lunar crew members greater autonomy during EVAs.;
Integration of an Artificial Intelligence Assistant (AIA) to reduce cognitive load and streamline decision-making.;
Support and coordination of rover operations through the LMCC, including locating and repairing the Lunar Terrain Vehicle (LTV).;
Creation of an Augmented Reality User Interface to help crew members adjust suit settings and view vital biomedical, navigational, and mission information in real time. Successfully deploy this on augmented reality headset.;
Have our proposal accepted and participate in the NASA SUITS challenge at Johnson Space Center in Houston this summer.
