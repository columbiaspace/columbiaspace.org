abstracttitle: "Wearable Augmented Reality for Space Suits"
abstracttext: "NASA SUITS (Spacesuit User Interface Technologies for Students) challenges students to design and create spacesuit information displays within augmented reality (AR) environments. "

introtext: "NASA’s Artemis missions aim to land American astronauts on the Moon
for the first time since the Apollo missions, but the ambition to explore
doesn’t end there. Through Artemis, we hope to set a presence on the moon that
will act as a gateway to further human space travel — and eventually reach Mars.
These goals however, come with unprecedented challenges . Namely the 20 minute
information delay between Earth and Mars. We aim to solve these challenges
through the NASA SUITS 2023 challenge."

goals: true
goalstext: "The creation and development of a dual monitor LMCC (Localized
Mission Control Center) to give Mars crew-members more autonomy during missions.
The ability to control a rover through the LMCC. The creation of an Augmented
Reality User Interface to help crew-members adjust Suit’s settings and view
vital biometric, navigational, mission, and geological information. We aim to
get our proposal accepted and participate in the challenge in Houston this
summer!"
