abstracttitle: "...Liftoff!"
abstracttext: "Our team is escaping the Earth's surface without aid from NASA or helium. Just good, old-fashioned rocket fuel!"

introtext: "The Columbia Rocketry Program designs, builds, and tests high performance rockets. As one of only a few collegiate rocketry teams worldwide developing hybrid rocket engines, we are a dedicated group of engineers and scientists focused on technical advancement. Through regular engine design iteration and testing, we are developing safe and reliable hybrid engines with adjustable thrust output. The Rocketry Program is currently putting to use our experiences gained over the last year from the 11 foot 56 lb. Athena II rocket to design and build our second entry in the Spaceport America Cup, Athena III. Through presentations and hands on engineering, our members gain valuable skills from engineering design software to machining to rocket dynamics and launch safety."

goals: true
goalstext: "This year, we will continue to refine and improve our design for a 600 lbf Class O nitrous-oxide/paraffin wax hybrid rocket engine. 
            This will be a clean sheet design, focusing on a modular airframe as well as an updated propulsion management system supported by more robust avionics. 
            New development will also emphasize iteration and test infrastructure, including an improved vertical engine test stand and advanced fluid systems testing infrastructure. 
            Through regular engine design iteration and testing, we are developing safe and reliable hybrid engines with adjustable thrust output. 
            This will allow us to integrate our entirely student developed engines with our airframes and electronics to compete at the Spaceport America Cup.;
            We also aim to regenerative cool the combustion chamber using a nitrous oxide preflow arrangement."
