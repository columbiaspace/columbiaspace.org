introtext: "The Columbia Rocketry Program designs, builds, and tests high performance rockets. As one of only a few collegiate rocketry teams worldwide developing hybrid rocket engines, we are a dedicated group of engineers and scientists focused on technical advancement. Through regular engine design iteration and testing, we are developing safe and reliable hybrid engines with adjustable thrust output. The Rocketry Program is currently putting to use our experiences gained over the last year from the 11 foot 56 lb. Athena II rocket to design and build our second entry in the Spaceport America Cup, Athena III. Through presentations and hands on engineering, our members gain valuable skills from engineering design software to machining to rocket dynamics and launch safety."
