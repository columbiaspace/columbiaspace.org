The Zero-G Division's 2019 mission goal was to develop a scientific payload for launch on Blue Origin’s New Shepard rocket. With the rocket’s altitude reaching nearly 100 kilometers, our experiment traveled beyond the Karman Line, the boundary between Earth’s atmosphere and outer space. Our project spent around 4 minutes in this microgravity environment, providing an exciting opportunity to conduct a scientific experiment. Our team consisted of four subteams: BME, Mech-E, EE and CS. Together, we developed a flight-ready biomedical research payload."
