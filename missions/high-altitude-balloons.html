abstracttext: "Sent Roaree to Space!"

introtext: "The High-Altitude Balloons mission launches two variations of balloons: heavy scientific to 100,000ft, and pico balloons to circumnavigate at 50,000ft. Both are led through team designs and custom manufactured payloads. We then track the balloon's flight, recover it upon landing, and analyse and present the collected data."

goals: true
goalstext: "Successfully plan and launch the group's new design of fleet of pico balloons.;
Research and design new balloons project (Coming SOON!);
Partner with research labs to make meaningful contributions to science"

skills: true
