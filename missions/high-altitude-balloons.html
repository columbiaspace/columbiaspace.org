abstracttitle: "Building experimental payloads for high altitude balloons."
abstracttext: "We send cameras, experiments, and other payloads to new heights."

introtext: "The Initiative's balloon group launches weather balloons with various scientific and educational goals. The balloons often go above 80,000ft, opening up a new range of opportunities and perspectives. Balloons are tracked via satellite and radio GPS trackers, and several payloads can be launched at once."

goals: true
goalstext: "Successfully plan and launch the group's first weather balloon;
Write and publish documentation for future launches by the club and others;
Perform outreach activities to increase interest in STEM;
Partner with research labs to make meaningful contributions to science"

skills: true
skillstext: "Physics and Chemistry: calculations to estimate the volume of gas;
Earth Sciences: understanding the earth's winds to predict the balloon's path;
Engineering: Building robust payloads and reliable electronics;
Education: Creating lesson plans and outreach activities from experiments"

achievements: true
achievementstext: "Received funding from the Columbia College Student Council.;
Received satellite tracker from the Columbia University Amateur Radio Club.;
Successfully launched ROAREE-1 to 108000ft. and retrieved scientific data and media."
